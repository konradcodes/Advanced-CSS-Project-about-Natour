# Advanced CSS Project about Natour

In this project i was introduced to npm packages and scripts to compile css to sass, autoprefixer and compile everything into production code. I was heavily focused on 7-1 Sass architecture so basically my main.scss file was only importing other sass files by using @import "folder/nameOfTheFile". By sticking to 7-1 architecture our code will be future-proof and well organised which will make your code easy to read and navigate through for other developers.
